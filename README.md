OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of ‚Äúobjects,‚Äù which are instances of classes. It helps organize and structure code in a modular, reusable, and scalable way.

**üîë Key Concepts of OOP:**

**Class**
A blueprint for creating objects (defines attributes and methods).

**Example:** class Car

**Object**
An instance of a class.

Example: Car myCar = new Car();

Encapsulation
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.

Protects data using access modifiers (private, public, protected).

Inheritance
Allows a class (child) to inherit features (methods and properties) from another class (parent).

Promotes code reusability.

Example: class ElectricCar extends Car

Polymorphism
One interface, many forms. It allows you to use a unified interface to different data types or classes.

Example: Method Overriding, Method Overloading.

Abstraction
Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features.

Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

üí° Benefits of OOP:
Code reusability

Easier debugging and maintenance

Scalability

Better organization and design
